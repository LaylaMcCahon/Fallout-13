<i>This server is a Medium-RP setting, please read through the rules and affiliate yourself on what is and is not to be expected of you as you play.<i>

<i><b>If this is your first time playing, please take a moment to go through the character setup menu. Select each role at least once to equip a default loadout or take a moment to customise your roles to your liking with the clothing options available. This is important as otherwise your character will spawn without equipment.<i><b>
